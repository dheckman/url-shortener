# Product Requirements

Your task is to build a front end for a URL shortening web service. The deliverable is the source code, written in React, using whichever libraries, frameworks, tools, and development methodologies you choose.

The front end should be a single page app that allows the user to:

- Input any URL to get a shortened version of it
- See a list of previously shortened URLs
- Expire/delete any previous URLs

The user should optionally be able to provide a custom slug to be used as the path in the shortened URL.

## Project Requirements

* The project should include an automated test suite.
* The project should include a README file with instructions for running the web service and its tests. You should also use the README to provide context on choices made during development.
* The project should be packaged as a zip file or submitted via a hosted git platform (Github, Gitlab, etc).

## Running the local server
